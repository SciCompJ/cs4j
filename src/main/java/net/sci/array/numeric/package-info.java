/**
 * Contains definitions of several numeric types, as well as specialization of
 * the Array interface for arrays containing numeric types.
 *
 * Most numeric types implement the Scalar interface: UInt8, UInt16, Int16,
 * Int32, Float32, Float64. The Binary type also implements the scalar
 * interface. Vector types correspond to type that contains several scalar
 * elements of the same type. It comprises Float32Vector, Float64Vector, as well
 * as Color types.
