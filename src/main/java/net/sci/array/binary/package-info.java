/**
 * Definition and implementations of binary arrays.
 * 
 * Binary arrays contain instances of {@link Binary}. Data can be encoded as
 * boolean, as byte, or using more memory-efficient encoding.
 * 
 * Binary extends the {@link net.sci.array.numeric.Int} type. Therefore, binary
 * arrays can be manipulated like any array of integers or scalars.
